# Features

The `modelhub` app provides a robust foundation for managing AI models, providers, API keys, routing rules, and performance metrics within the Dataelan platform. This app enables organizations to securely manage, monitor, and optimize their use of external and internal AI models.

## Overview

- **Provider Management:**
  - Register and manage LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
  - Store provider metadata, configuration, and documentation links.
- **Model Registry:**
  - Register and configure AI models from various providers.
  - Track model capabilities, costs, context window, and status.
- **API Key Management:**
  - Securely store encrypted API keys per provider and organization.
  - Set quotas, monitor usage, and track health.
- **Routing Rules:**
  - Define rules for routing requests to specific models based on context, type, or organization.
  - Assign weights and conditions for advanced selection.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Track latency, token usage, costs, and error rates for each model and API key.
  - Provide dashboards and summaries for optimization.

## Key Workflows

- **Model Selection & Routing:**
  - Use routing rules to dynamically select the best model for a given use case, optimizing for cost, performance, or compliance.
- **Cost Estimation:**
  - Estimate costs for model usage before executing requests (via API or UI).
- **Quota & Health Monitoring:**
  - Monitor API key usage, quotas, and health status for governance and reliability.
- **Dashboard & Analytics:**
  - Summarize model performance, costs, and optimization insights for admins.
